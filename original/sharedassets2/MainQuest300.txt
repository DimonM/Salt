You've proven to be a very capable adventurer, if I do say so myself. I suppose you're ready for a more dangerous task. I know a fellow who goes by the name of Lenvell. He occasionally stops by my inns so be on the lookout for him during your travels. Once you find him, tell him I sent you and he'll know what it's about.
